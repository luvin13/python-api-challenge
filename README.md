Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?


ANALYSIS FOR WEATHERPY:


Noticable trends based on data:


For both the northern and southern hemispheres, max temperature increased as we got closer to the equator (0 degrees latitude).


In the northern hemisphere, Wind Speed peaked at 35 mph at 40 degrees latitude, while in the southern hemisphere Wind Speed peaked at 25 mph at -20 degrees latitude.

Overall humidity on Earth seems to be lowest at 20 degrees latitude. Every other reigon had potential to reach maximum humidity.
